# Installation

We recommend reading the installation documentation of Drupal: [https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install]().  
You can get Thunder by downloading it from [https://www.drupal.org/project/thunder](). We suggest the usage of composer for downloading thunder and managing your additional modules. See [here](https://github.com/BurdaMagazinOrg/thunder-project) for a description howto do that.
Download the newest release and install it into your web server document root. Now open the URL pointing to the document root, where you will be directed through the installation process.
