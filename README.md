Quick install

2.    Open the Acquia Dev Desktop. Click on “+“ and then on “New Drupal Site“.
3.    Find Thunder in the list and click on “Install“. You’ll be asked to fill a form with some data, but for testing Thunder just leave it as it is. Click “Finish” and Thunder will be downloaded to your system.
4.    After this process is finished, click on the link to the „Local site” and Thunder will open in your browser.
5.    The menu will navigate you through the installation process. Choose your language and click on “Save and continue”.
6.    In the next step, you can configure your installation: add a site name, your e-mail-address, a user name and a password. Click on “Save and continue”.
7.    Now you could choose additional modules, but for an easy start, we recommend using the default selection. Click on “Save and Continue” for the last time.
