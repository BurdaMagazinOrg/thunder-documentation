If you want to help… Here are some things we believe to be important for publishers, but which we are not working on right now:
* [Workflow initiative](https://www.drupal.org/node/2721129)
* Keep the reader engaged with a pop-up at the end of the article, recommending other articles or visiting the homepage or similar things
* Give readers a chance to react to an article and to send a message to the editor
* Auto-saving for article editor
* Set the focal point automatically (for example, at the eyes of a portrayed person)
* Introduce the paging of article, so one article could consist of multiple pages to click through
* Help with the documentation: proofread and improve our documentation - or volunteer to add something missing

Feel free to start working on any of these topics. To make sure your developments will find their way into the Thunder distribution, please involve us at an early state. We aim at keeping Thunder as modular as possible.
And if you don’t feel like you could do this on your own - no problem. That’s what the community is for! Just tell us if you want to work on one of the topics or if you have any idea how to implement the needed functionality.
