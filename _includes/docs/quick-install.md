2. Open the Acquia Dev Desktop. Click on “+“ and then on “New Drupal Site“.
3. Find Thunder in the list and click on “Install“. You’ll be asked to fill a form with some data, but for testing Thunder just leave it as it is. Click “Finish” and Thunder will be downloaded to your system.
4. After this process is finished, click on the link to the „Local site” and Thunder will open in your browser.
5. The menu will navigate you through the installation process. Choose your language and click on “Save and continue”.
