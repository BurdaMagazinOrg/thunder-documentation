Versioning has to follow the drupal versioning specification:
[https://www.drupal.org/documentation/version-info/numbers](https://www.drupal.org/documentation/version-info/numbers)

If changes are introduced, which could break existing installations, e.g. by breaking the API, removing significant functionalities, or rewriting the module, a new major version has to be released.
