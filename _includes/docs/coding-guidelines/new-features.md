Development of new features should take place in a feature branch of the module in question. After development is complete, a pull-request has to be opened, which needs to be peer-reviewed and merged by **another person**.

If you want to develop for Thunder-owned module, please fork the github repository and open a pull-request for the feature or bugfix. It will then be peer-reviewed and merged by a team member of the repository.
