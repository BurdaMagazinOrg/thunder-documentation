Writing tests is essential for high-quality software. Everyone has to understand that writing test saves time and money in the long run.


### Writing a new feature

Best practice for developing a new feature is to start with the implementation of the tests. For each acceptance criteria in a user-story, implement some tests which covers them. If all the tests succeed you can be confident that your feature works like expected.


### Resolving an issue

Before resolving an issue, implement a test which covers this issue. After that, resolve the issue until all failing tests are fixed.


### Large codebase, but no tests.

If you have an existing project but no tests, donâ€™t worry, you can easily start. Write tests while resolving issues and your test coverage will grow with every bug.


### Choose the right testing-framework

For high-level integration tests we recommend to write test in Behat. But Behat is not always a good decision. Maybe you want to test an API or a small part of code then PHPUnit is the better choice. So think about it before start writing the tests.
