Configuration options for modules can be in many places.
The most common places to look for are the `Extend` and the `Configuration` page.
Both can be accessed via the menu at the top.
Also, the documentation of the module on [http://drupal.org](http://drupal.org) should point to the correct place.
Note that not all modules have configuration pages.

### Extend page
Go to the `Extend` page and search for your module.
If the module is configurable and the maintainer included the correct route in his module,
you can find a `Configure` link in the module details, which you can open by clicking on the module description.

### Configuration page
Go to the `Configuration` page and search for your module.
If the module is configurable, you might see a link to its configuration page here.
