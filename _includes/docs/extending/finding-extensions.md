You can find many extensions on [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/download).
Scroll down on the `Download & Extend` page. Here you can either click on `Modules` or `Themes`, to search through all extensions,
or view the _Most installed_ and newest ones.

If you know what module you want, it is often fastest to just google it, adding `drupal` to the search.
