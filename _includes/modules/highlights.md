**Paragraphs**: Instead of putting all their content in one WYSIWYG body field including images and videos, end-users can now choose on-the-fly between pre-defined Paragraph Types independent from one another. Paragraph Types can be anything you want from a simple text block or image to a complex and configurable slideshow. This allows editors to structure an article into sub-elements, which can easily be created, edited, and reorganized.<br />

**Media Entity**: Media entity provides a 'base' entity for media. This is a very basic entity which can reference to all kinds of media-objects (local files, YouTube videos, Tweets, Instagram photos, ...). Media entity provides a relation between Drupal and the media resource. You can reference to and use this entity within any other Drupal entity. This module comes with several sub-modules (see below).<br />

**Entity Browser**: This module provides a generic entity browser/picker/selector. In Thunder, it serves as media library which gives you an overview of all your media entities, such as pictures and videos. You can filter and search for them, edit them, and add new media.<br />

**Thunder Updater**: This is a combination of the modules Checklist API and Configuration Update Manager. Thunder checks if installed configurations have been changed – if not, they can be updated. Otherwise you will get a message telling you that there’s an available update and what to do if you wish to have it.<br />

**Config Selector**: This module provides Thunder the functionality to install different configuration objects for the same purpose depending on the modules that are enabled. That means, for example, there could be different content views, depending on the modules that are enabled.
