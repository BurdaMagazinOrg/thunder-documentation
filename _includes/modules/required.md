Most of the modules shipped with Thunder are enabled by default and can be disabled if you don't need them.
However, some modules are an integral component of Thunder and can never be deactivated. These modules are:
**Thunder Updater**: This is a combination of the modules Checklist API and Configuration Update Manager. Thunder checks if installed configurations have been changed – if not, they can be updated. Otherwise you will get a message telling you that there’s an available update and what to do if you wish to have it.<br />

+**Config Selector**: This module provides Thunder the functionality to install different configuration objects for the same purpose depending on the modules that are enabled. That means, for example, there could be different content views, depending on the modules that are enabled.
